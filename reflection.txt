Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
in my final project I created two functions to identify the OS of the computer and do something.
The coolest thing about those functions is that they verfiy the OS of your computer and actually check with commands from the terminal.
then take that information and pass it to the program. without functions I would be so lost in the code. 
I now see how creating these little chunks of code is the way.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
For the most part I think testing functions os a good idea. it helps us understand the basics of a function.
but honestly in the real world they dont get used and are from my observations frowned apon. It is unecessary code.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
I really liked the debug feature in VSCode. That was a pretty big game changer for me. 
secondly I really liked using a python code validator site that can walk through the code to check it.
It doesnt always support complex code but over all does a good job.
